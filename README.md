Hi. This project is about the intelegent monitoring of a farm. It's an iot system that requires the following equipements :
- Different Sensors (DHT22, light sensor, soil moisture sensor, )
- Microcontroller (ESP32)
- Micro ordi (Raspberry Pi 3 used as a server)
- actuators (Cooling Fan, Pump, Servomotor for the window)
